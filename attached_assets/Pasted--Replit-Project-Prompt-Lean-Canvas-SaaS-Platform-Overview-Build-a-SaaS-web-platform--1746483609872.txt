### Replit Project Prompt: Lean Canvas SaaS Platform

#### Overview:

Build a SaaS web platform allowing users to create, view, and manage business ideas, each represented as individual "projects." Each project will include a Lean Canvas generated through integration with an external n8n scenario triggered via webhook.

#### Functional Requirements:

1. **User Authentication:**

   * Implement sign-up/login using email and password.
   * Provide secure user sessions with logout functionality.

2. **Project Management (CMS-like structure):**

   * Allow authenticated users to view a dashboard listing their ideas (projects).
   * Each idea should show a status (e.g., "Draft," "Generating," "Completed").
   * Allow users to click on an idea to view detailed information and its associated Lean Canvas.

3. **Creating New Ideas:**

   * Provide a form to submit new ideas.
   * Required Field:

     * `Idea` (text)
   * Optional Fields:

     * Founder Name
     * Founder Email
     * Company Stage
     * Website URL
     * Company Name
   * Form submission triggers the external n8n scenario via webhook.

4. **Webhook Integration:**

   * After form submission, the app must send data via webhook POST request to trigger the n8n scenario.
   * The n8n scenario processes and generates a Lean Canvas, writes data to its internal systems (like Supabase), and sends results back via webhook to the application.

5. **Notification System:**

   * Upon receiving completion webhook from n8n scenario, update project status.
   * Display real-time on-screen notifications informing users that their Lean Canvas has been generated.

6. **Lean Canvas Management:**

   * Display generated Lean Canvas clearly structured in sections: Problem, Customer Segments, Unique Value Proposition, Solution, Channels, Revenue Streams, Cost Structure, Key Metrics, Unfair Advantage.
   * Allow users to edit and save changes to any Lean Canvas section.
   * Provide functionality to regenerate the Lean Canvas via triggering the webhook again with existing or updated inputs.

#### Technical Stack Suggestion:

* Front-end: React or Next.js with Tailwind CSS or Material UI.
* Backend/API: Node.js or Python FastAPI.
* Database: Supabase/PostgreSQL.
* Webhooks: n8n, Axios or Fetch API for integration.

#### Future-Proofing:

* Keep architecture flexible to add new sections or integrations later.
* Ensure robust error handling and clear user messaging for a seamless user experience.
